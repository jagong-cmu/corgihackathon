All notable changes to Chalk are documented here.
Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) · versions are `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.MICRO`.

## [0.1.1.0] - 2026-07-26

### Changed
- Tutors are picked from the sidebar only. The tutor card's dropdown picker is
  gone — the card shows the active tutor with a single "Start session" button.
- "Manage voice tutors" now lives in the sidebar, right under "Create a new
  tutor", so every tutor action starts from one place.
- Seating a whiteboard-only tutor (like Trudy) shows a quiet hint pointing to
  the sidebar instead of an unexplained disabled button.

### Fixed
- Nico shows up in the tutor list on deployed hosts: the production server now
  answers `/api/live/tutors` (it previously 404'd, so deployed clients fell
  back to a roster without him), and Nico joined the offline fallback list.
- Coach Rios's avatar provider matches the worker's persona file (lemonslice).
- Tutor entries supplied via the `TUTOR_LIBRARY` env var are validated and
  normalized before serving: missing fields get safe defaults (a tutor without
  a declared voice can't be rung) and unexpected fields are never exposed.

### Added
- Tutor roster guardrails (`npm run test:tutors`): 24 checks keeping the
  client fallback list, the served library, and the production route in
  lockstep — including a live boot of the production server.
